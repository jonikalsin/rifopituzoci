Danes just received a Golden Globe nomination for her portrayal in the FX on Hulu drama Fleishman Is in Trouble.&nbsp;Danes and Dancy have two children. Cyrus, their first child, was born in 2012, and Rowan, their second child, was born in 2018. Dancy, 47, told the Evening Standard in 2013 that he was adapting to his everyday life with his wife, kids, and job and remarked,</p><p>“If Hannibal returns, [Claire’s and I] schedules would overlap by a couple of months. That means either I could be with her or she could be with me, or neither of us would be working and we’d have to commute.”</p><p>During an FYC event for Homeland in 2018, Danes talked about her first pregnancy and her experience with it. She said that it was her ninth month and that she had been working prior to that.</p><p></p><h2>Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy met in 2006 while shooting Evening.</h2><p>Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy initially met while filming the drama picture Evening in 2006. Danes said in an interview with Marie Claire that she was unmarried at the time and that she and Dancy became great friends. She went on,</p><p>“[Hugh and I] met in Rhode Island in the autumn when it was at its most audaciously gorgeous. And there was one day when we were riding by the sea and everything was sparkling and lovely, and I had this stupid revelation, like, ‘I’m really just happy.'”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Claire-Danes-1.jpg alt="Claire Danes" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In June 2007, the two were seen together at an Afghan Hands Foundation event and at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. The couple got engaged in 2009 and married the following year. Narciso Rodriguez created Claire’s wedding gown.&nbsp;Claire said in 2012 that she feels safe with Hugh and that her mother informed her that a lengthy marriage can always work. She went on,</p><p>“My parents have been together since they were 18, so I am blessed to have them as role models. Marriage appeals to me. I’m feeling extremely safe. It is beneficial when you are in love with your spouse. I sometimes glance at him and think, ‘You are incredibly gorgeous.’ He keeps me happy and sane.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Claire-Danes-2.jpg alt="Claire Danes" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Claire Danes began her profession while she was in her teens.</h2><p>Claire Danes began her profession as a teen.
