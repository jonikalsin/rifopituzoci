He had to deal with a variety of issues, including depression, insomnia, anxiety, and others. Kweli said that they presented him as a monster who despises black women. Kweli further said that about 500,000 of his followers, as well as his ex-wife and workers, are all black. Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for G/O Media said,</p><p>“Jezebel’s story accurately reported on the dispute that resulted in Talib Kweli’s Twitter account being permanently suspended.” This litigation, brought two years after the article was published, is without substance, and the corporation will seek our lawyers’ costs in accordance with the rights granted to the press to publish stories of public importance like this one.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Talib Kweli is suing Jezebel over a story she wrote… simply leave Ashley alone</p><p>— Italian Elon Musk (@xoxogossipgita) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 9, 2022</a></p><h2>Everything there is to know about Talib Kweli’s ex-wife</h2><p>DJ Eque is a well-known DJ and mixer.

However, they had a nasty disagreement at a party in 2010 when Kweli was chatting to other ladies, which resulted in a physical brawl and the need for security to remove them. DJ Eque and Talib Kweli were married for eleven years and their divorce date and time are unclear.</p><h2>Talib Kweli’s story on Jezebel</h2><p>Kweli announced his departure from Twitter in July 2020. However, according to Jezebel, he was removed from Twitter for breaching their rules after a few posts he put to disparage a student and activist named Maya Moody.&nbsp;Fans of Kweli have also been accused of threatening Moody and leaking personal information about her and her family. The cause for Kweli’s disagreement with Moody was that she mentioned colorism during a discussion about the spouses of a few artists, including Kweli.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Talib-Kweli-2.webp alt="Talib Kweli" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Kweli is a New York-based rapper who rose to prominence after working with Mos Def in 1997.
