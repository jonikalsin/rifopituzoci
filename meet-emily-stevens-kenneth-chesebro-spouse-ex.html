In its 2020 election interference case, the Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney’s office offered him a plea deal. However, he declined it, a source with knowledge of the situation revealed on Thursday.</p><p>This week’s trial for Kenneth, a lawyer accused of aiding in the development of a “strategy for disrupting and delaying the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021,” is scheduled. Sidney Powell, a former Trump attorney, was supposed to testify with him in the initial trial, but she surprisingly pleaded guilty Thursday morning.</p><p>Read all that we know about his wife here in this article below.</p><h3><strong>Meet Emily Stevens, Kenneth Chesebro Former Spouse</strong></h3><p>Kenneth Chesebro was previously married to Emily Stevens. They reportedly exchanged their vows in 1994 in Bermuda with lawyer Laurence Tribe attending the event. They lived modestly in an apartment across from the Harvard campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p><p>The couple reportedly stayed married until 2014.</p><p>It is not clear why the couple ended their marriage. The couple may have shared at least one child but they kept their relationship private and not many details are public.</p><p>After divorcing Emily, Kenneth relocated to Boston’s Ritz Carlson Residences and eventually to a penthouse on Central Park South in New York. He started wooing a young woman and paid for her travels all over the world, including birthday celebrations in Paris and London at the age of 21. Apparently, they got married after that, based on a family friend.</p><p>In the Georgia election tampering case that indicted him and 18 others, Kenneth Chesebro, a lawyer who wrote memoranda outlining how Republicans could send phony slates of presidential electors to Congress, entered a guilty plea. On Friday, Chesebro entered a plea of guilty to one felony count of conspiring to file fraudulent paperwork. He was advised by the prosecution to testify at trial, serve five years of probation, make restitution payments, and conduct community service.</p><p>Kenneth’s trial was supposed to start with jury selection on Friday. The lawyer, who had asked for a fast trial in the case, was scheduled to testify with lawyer Sidney Powell on Thursday, but she also accepted a plea agreement.</p><p>The Powell and Chesebro trial in October was anticipated as a type of trial run for the broad account of the purported conspiracy by the prosecution. The case’s further defendants, including former President Donald Trump, do not yet have a trial date scheduled. In the Georgia case, Chesebro was accused of seven felonies, including racketeering.</p><p>The indictment claims that despite losing the elections in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, one of his memos “provides detailed, state-specific instructions for how Trump presidential elector nominees in Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin would meet and cast electoral votes” for Trump.</p><p>Kenneth is the son of Marlene Chesebro and Donald Chesebro. His parents married on 16 June 1976. Kenneth, born in 1961, turned 62 years old in 2023.</p><p>Kenneth’s LinkedIn profile says “Kenneth Chesebro has handled more than 100 cases in the <a href=#>U.S. Supreme Court</a> and lower courts, frequently on behalf of trial lawyers pursuing high-profile litigation against corporations.” Typically he represented Democratic plaintiffs. In 1993 Chesebro wrote a long article in the&nbsp;American University Law Review defending work for such plaintiffs and skewering “Reagan Administration ideologues and their colleagues in Congress.”</p><h3><strong>Emily Stevens Age</strong></h3><p>Emily Stevens was reportedly born in May 1962. She is now 61 years old.</p><h3><strong>Emily Stevens Job</strong></h3><p>Emily Stevens is a physician turned lawyer. She graduated from the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in 1989. She works in CAMBRIDGE, MA, and specializes in Surgery and Oncology.</p><p>According to Vitals, Emily has over 34 years of experience in her field.</p><h3><strong>Is Emily Stevens On Instagram?</strong></h3><p>No, Emily Stevens is not available on Instagram or Facebook.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Emily Stevens From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Emily Stevens appears to be residing in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Emily Stevens Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Emily Stevens’s birthday is in June.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpp2VqXqmucilsGarpJrDprrSZqKepp6awal5wqGcrJ2Sp7xuv8%2BorKydXZrFcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rick-edelstein.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Rick Edelstein Net Worth?">&larr;
