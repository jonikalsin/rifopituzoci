So let’s find out how much he is worth.</strong></p><p>Dick Van Dyke is an American actor and comedian famously known for his successful series “The Dick Van Dyke Show.” The show, which started airing in 1961, became his most recognized work in the Industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Van Dyke was largely unknown in the movie industry before starring in the series. Although the series started slowly, the comedian won fans with good humor and likeability. As the years progressed, the series developed into a fan favorite.&nbsp;</p><p>The show’s success also <a href=#>paved</a> the way for him to star in other Hollywood projects. In 1963 he starred in the musical “Bye Bye Birdie” and received massive praise for his performance. For his performance in the musical, Van Dyke won a Tony Award in 1961.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>After “The Dick Van Dyke Show” stopped airing in 1966, the comedian starred in a couple of projects, including “The New Dick Van Dyke Show.” “Mary Poppins,” and “Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang.”&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1990s, he starred in the drama series “Diagnosis Murder” as Dr. Marl Sloan, a medical professional. After the series ended in 2001, Van Dyke returned to the small screen in the 2006 series “Murder 101.”</p><p>That same year the comedian starred in two more movies; “Night at the Museum” with Ben Stiller and “Chita Rivera: The Dancer’s Life.” Van Dyke continued starring in films, and in 2013 he received the Actors Guild Achievement Award. He joined Denzel Washington in the exclusive list of actors to have <a href=#>won </a>the SAG and Tony Awards.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dick_Van_Dykes_Net_Worth></span><strong>Dick Van Dyke’s Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Most of Dick Van Dyke’s earnings have come from his lifetime career in the entertainment industry. The comedian has starred in many movies, musicals, TV sitcoms, and dramas. He is also a talented director and producer.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>According to Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Dick Van Dyke’s net worth is $50 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Dick_Van_Dyke_Married_His_First_Wife_on_Live_Radio></span><strong>Dick Van Dyke Married His First Wife on Live Radio</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Van Dyke and Margie Willett had been together for a couple of years without officially marrying each other. However, in 1948 they surprised fans when they got married on live radio.&nbsp;Although fans knew that they got married in that fashion, no one knew why they took that step.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/5a/e2/af/5ae2af94a9473e0011d28520e62ba07b.jpg><p>However, in 2016 the comedian decided to reveal the secrets behind the radio wedding.&nbsp;According to Van Dyke, he and his wife Margie Willett had no money for a wedding.&nbsp;He <a href=#>noted</a>:</p><p><strong>“We were too broke to get married. We exchanged our vows in front of a minister and two radio microphones while 15 million people listened!”</strong></p><p>A radio producer had offered to pay for their wedding and honeymoon if they tied the knot on his show. Van Dyke and his saw the offer was good, and they took it.&nbsp;Although the actor’s first wife, Willett, wasn’t one for the spotlight, she had a unique role during their radio wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, their marriage lasted for 36 years, and they became parents to four kids. Van Dyke and Willett divorced after the comedian started an affair with his agent’s secretary Michelle Triola. Sadly, Willett died of pancreatic cancer in 2008.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=His_Parents_Lied_to_Him_About_His_Age></span><strong>His Parents Lied to Him About His Age</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 1943 Van Dyke was living with his parents in Danville, Illinois. At that time, war was happening in Europe, and his family had moved far away from the war.&nbsp;Van Dyke’s 18th birthday was coming up, making him eligible for the draft. However, he wanted to avoid infantry and instead join the Air Force.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/4e/52/8d/4e528de02d22d960e14c9c065b573dda.jpg><p>The actor, who weighed six feet one inch and 130 pounds, decided to share his thoughts with his mother. Then, while she was washing the dishes, he <a href=#>declared</a>:</p><p><strong>“I’m going to be eighteen in March, that means I’ll be up for the draft. I really don’t want to go — and I really don’t want to be in the infantry. So I’m thinking that I ought to join now and try to get in the Air Force.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>His mother waited until she finished the dishes before telling him a secret they had hidden from him. Then, to Van Dyke’s shock, his mother disclosed he was already 18.&nbsp;</p><p>She revealed they kept the information from him because he was born prematurely. Also, there were some complications with his birth, which was why they pushed his birthdate forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, Van Dyke was unsatisfied with her explanation, so he went to his paternal grandmother for more information. Finally, however, he received the shock of his life when his granny <a href=#>said</a>:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>“You weren’t premature. You were conceived out of wedlock.”&nbsp;</strong></p><p>She further explained that his mother had gotten pregnant before she and his father got married. So, although nobody admitted it, Van Dyke’s birth was probably why they got married.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=He_Wrote_a_Book_on_Aging></span><strong>He Wrote a Book on Aging</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2015 Van Dyke released his memoir <a href=#>titled</a> “Keep Moving.” In the book, the comedian noted the secrets of staying healthy close to his 90th birthday in the book. According to the actor, his ability to dance has kept him young and still vigorous.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/68/60/15/6860156154c3acca75a7d42f1c216086.jpg><p>Van Dyke disclosed if he were out shopping and heard music playing, he would start dancing. Also, if he wanted to sing, he would sing. The comedian does not follow any rules on how people his age should act.</p><p>The comedian also shared he conquered Arthritis, Pneumonia, and other lung complications by doing what he loves to do; dancing, singing, and every other thing that passes as fun for him. The veteran actor also advised youths to be curious, travel, eat light, and treat themselves to dessert at the end of every day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ksaqvymatmqZdmcassdJmpZ6sXay8s8DHZquhqpWaeqetwq2qZpmSpMK1edOhnGaskaGyr8DEnWSam6Skv3A%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./famous-firsts-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Historical Firsts That Happened Way Before You Realized">&larr;
