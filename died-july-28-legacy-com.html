She was the prim and proper Mrs. Peacock in the cult film hit “Clue,” and she turned in great performances in classic films like “The Sting” and “The Last Picture Show.” On Broadway, she played Irene Malloy in the original production of “Hello, Dolly!” We remember Brennan’s life today as well as the lives of other notable people who died this day in history.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Click to discover notable people who were born this day in history including first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.</a></strong></p><p><strong>2021: <a href=#>Dusty Hill</a></strong>, longtime bassist for the legendary rock band ZZ Top, dies at 72.</p><p></p><p><strong>2014: </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>James Shigeta</strong></a>, U.S. actor known for roles in “Flower Drum Song” and “Die Hard,” dies at 85.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ak-cache.legacy.net/usercontent/ns/photos/shigeta.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a>Shigeta made a name for himself as one of Hollywood’s first prominent Asian-American leading men.
