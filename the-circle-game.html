The lyrics describe the experience of a child who catches a dragonfly in a jar and is afraid of thunder and moved to tears by the falling of a star. The seasons continue to cycle, and the child grows up, experiencing the passing of time and the changes that come with it. The lyrics are a reminder that life is cyclical, and we are all "captive on the carousel of time", unable to go back, but only able to look behind us and appreciate the experiences that have brought us to where we are now.</p><br><p>The song is poetic in its metaphorical use of "painted ponies" and "carousel of time" to describe the cycle of life. The lyrics also show the difference between the perspective of a child and that of an adult, as the child is eager for the future, while the adult has come to terms with the passing of time and the inevitability of change. The song culminates in an acknowledgement that life will continue to cycle, with new dreams replacing old ones, until the final revolution is complete.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Yesterday a child came out to wonder</u><br>A child was full of curiosity and open-mindedness</p><br><p><u>Caught a dragonfly inside a jar</u><br>The child was fascinated by the beauty of nature and wanted to preserve it</p><br><p><u>Fearful when the sky was full of thunder</u><br>The child was afraid of unknown dangers and things beyond their control</p><br><p><u>And tearful at the falling of a star</u><br>The child was saddened by the loss of something beautiful or wonderous</p><br><p><u>And the seasons they go round and round</u><br>Time moves forward in a cyclical fashion, with events repeating themselves</p><br><p><u>And the painted ponies go up and down</u><br>Life is unpredictable and full of ups and downs</p><br><p><u>We're captive on the carousel of time</u><br>We cannot control time, but we are forced to move along with it</p><br><p><u>We can't return we can only look behind</u><br>We cannot change the past, but we can reflect on it</p><br><p><u>From where we came</u><br>Our past experiences shape who we are and influence our present</p><br><p><u>And go round and round and round</u><br>Life is a cycle that continues indefinitely</p><br><p><u>Then the child moved ten times round the seasons</u><br>The child grew up and experienced the changing of the seasons ten times</p><br><p><u>Skated over ten clear frozen streams</u><br>The child experienced life and the beauty of nature in different ways</p><br><p><u>Words like, when you're older, must appease him</u><br>Adults tell the child to be patient and wait for maturity to fully experience life</p><br><p><u>And promises of someday make his dreams</u><br>The child is promised that their dreams will come true if they wait long enough</p><br><p><u>Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now</u><br>The child has gone through sixteen seasons of life</p><br><p><u>Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town</u><br>The child has grown up and changed in many ways</p><br><p><u>And they tell him, take your time, it won't be long now</u><br>People advise the child to enjoy the present moment and not grow up too quickly</p><br><p><u>Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down</u><br>The child will eventually grow older and want to slow down the passage of time</p><br><p><u>So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty</u><br>The child has continued to age and is no longer a child</p><br><p><u>Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true</u><br>The child's dreams may have been realized, but they may not have been as grand as he originally thought</p><br><p><u>There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty</u><br>Even if some dreams have been realized, there are always new dreams waiting to be discovered</p><br><p><u>Before the last revolving year is through</u><br>There are always new experiences to be had before the end of life</p><br><p><u>And go round and round and round</u><br>Life's cycle continues indefinitely</p><br><p><u>In the circle game</u><br>Life is a game that continues in a circular fashion</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © O/B/O APRA AMCOS<br>Written by: Joni Mitchell</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIKfo7agmcitmqGdnKF8lbTEmHqiqpOhsqCTwKac</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-andrea-soros-colombel-meet-george-soros-5-youngsters.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Andrea Soros Colombel?
