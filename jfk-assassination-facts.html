Kennedy was shot to death in Dallas, Texas by <a href=# rel=noopener>Lee Harvey Oswald</a> (whose role in the assassination remains in dispute).</p><p>Oswald was soon apprehended in a nearby theater, after shooting and killing police officer J.D. Tippet, who had rolled up alongside Oswald after seeing that he matched the description of the Kennedy shooter.</p><p>Then, Oswald himself was shot to death by a local nightclub owner and minor underworld figure named Jack Ruby before he could stand trial for Kennedy's murder. Ruby died of cancer in prison soon after, and with the major players now gone, much of the mystery behind the assassination may have died with them.</p><p>Despite, or perhaps because of, this, the assassination has remained one of the most hotly-debated points of interest among conspiracy theorists for decades, with many laying the blame for Kennedy's death on parties including Cuba, the CIA, the Mafia, and even then-Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson.</p><p>But while such speculation has held people's interest for decades, little of it is likely grounded in fact. Above are some of the most fascinating JFK assassination facts you'll ever read.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async alt="Who Killed Jfk" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img//thumb/300.megaphone.imgix.net/podcasts/e6e7b45e-88b9-11ee-8b35-bb249cff44d2/image/jfk-cover1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> History Uncovered Podcast Episode 96: Who Really Killed JFK?
