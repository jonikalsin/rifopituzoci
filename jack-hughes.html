To join the Canadian Hockey League a year early, Hughes petitioned for special status while playing for the Mississauga Rebels of the Greater Toronto Hockey League. After being turned down, he played his last season with the Toronto Marlboros, where he scored 159 points in his final season of eligibility.</p><p>Hughes was selected eighth overall by the Mississauga Steelheads of the Ontario Hockey League after finishing his minor league career with the Marlboros, despite his commitment to the United States National Team Development Program (USNTDP). Hughes stuck to his word and competed with the USNTDP in 2017–18. He scored 116 points throughout his stint with the U17 and U18 teams, which nearly equaled Auston Matthews’ record. Hughes was named the top American-born junior hockey player by the Dave Tyler Junior Player of the Year Award at the end of the 2017–18 season.</p><p>Clayton Keller had held the NTDP all-time points record until Hughes broke it in the 2018–19 season. On March 15, 2019, he scored five points in a 12–4 victory over the Green Bay Gamblers, giving him a total of 190. Cole Caufield, a teammate, also set a new NTDP goal-scoring record in the same game.</p><p>On June 21, 2019, the New Jersey Devils picked Hughes first in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. He signed a three-year deal with the Devils on July 12. In a game opposing the New York Rangers on October 17, Hughes scored his first NHL point. He became the franchise’s third-youngest player to score a point. Two days later, he scored his first NHL goal in a 1–0 victory over the Vancouver Canucks.</p><p>Hughes extended his deal with the Devils for eight years and $64 million on November 30th, 2021. Despite missing 17 games in October due to a dislocated shoulder, the following 2021–22 season was seen as a breakout year for Hughes. It wasn’t until 2022 that he was named to his first NHL All-Star Game. Hughes’ season ended in early April when he suffered an MCL sprain after a hit by New York Islanders right wing Oliver Wahlstrom, ending his season after collecting a career-high 26 goals and 30 assists in 49 games.</p><p>As a member of the 2018 IIHF World U18 Championships All-Star team and the tournament’s top forward, he was voted the tournament MVP. In addition to becoming the tournament’s top scorer, he played in all seven games.&nbsp;</p><p>This year’s World Junior Ice Hockey Championships will include Hughes and his younger brother Quinn, who were both picked to play on December 23. A mysterious ailment kept Hughes out of the tournament’s first three games, but he recovered in time to assist Team USA in defeating the Czech Republic. In his comeback, he was credited with an assist on Noah Cates’ goal.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, four assists from Hughes helped Team USA advance to the gold medal match, although Finland beat them. When Team USA finished third in the 2019 IIHF World U18 Championships, the young American forward broke Alexander Ovechkin’s goal-scoring record.</p><p>Earlier this month, he was added to the United States World Championship team alongside his brother.
