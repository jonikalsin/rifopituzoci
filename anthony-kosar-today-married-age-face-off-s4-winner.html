So, where is the season 4 winner Anthony Kosar now? What does he do? Is he married now? Who are his family members?</p><p>Scroll down this article for the answers.</p><h3><strong>Meet Anthony Kosar, Face Off S4 Winner</strong></h3><p>Kosar won the Face Off Season 4 Championship in 2013. The largest competition for Make-Up FX is Face Off, a reality-based competition on the Syfy Channel. Kosar won 6 of the 11 Spotlight Challenges and 1 of the 4 Foundation Challenges, breaking records for the most wins by a single contestant in a single season and the most wins in a row.</p><p>Throughout the course of the show, Kosar has made several appearances as one of the most well-known and esteemed champions in the series. He returned in Season 5 to mentor the candidates for that episode and to introduce the “Mother Earth Goddess” task.</p><p>During Season 7, Anthony also made an appearance on Face Off: Judge Match, where he assisted his judge Neville Page in defeating the other judges. In addition, he was one of the three champions chosen to lead artistic teams on Face Off Season 8. Since then, Kosar has had a number of his Kosart School students participate and even win on Face Off.</p><h3><strong>Where Is Anthony Kosar Today?</strong></h3><p>Being a prosthetic makeup artist, Anthony Kosar has been doing well for himself and even imparting his knowledge to others after appearing on the show. In addition to being Kosart Studios’ Lead Artist, the company’s MUFX Designer is also its Founder. He also conducts Pop-Up Masterclasses where interested students can learn everything the reality star has to teach.</p><p>Despite the fact that Kosart Studios is headquartered in Westmont, Illinois, Anthony has made sure that the organization’s work transcends national boundaries; as of this writing, its scope has grown throughout North America.</p><p>Anthony’s contributions to some of the most recent projects have only served to astound people worldwide. He actually worked on “Candyman,” “Fargo,” “Shining Girls,” “Paper Girls,” and “Fargo” season 1 as the Special FX Make-Up Department Head and Make-Up FX Designer. But his best work may have been in “Lovecraft Country’s” first episode, for which he and Anna Cali were nominated for an Emmy in the Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup category.</p><h3><strong>Anthony Kosar Career</strong></h3><p>Anthony Kosar has always had an interest in the arts, having painted and drawn since he was a little child. Because of his mother Lynda’s experience as a dance instructor and choreographer, he also grew up in the theater and on stage. Anthony’s passion for Halloween, monsters, and movies, combined with his background in the visual and performing arts, has inspired him to pursue a career in special effects.</p><p>After years of winning art completions, and doing his own make-ups for Halloween, in 2002 at age 16, he created his first foam-latex prosthetic, the ‘Zombie’ through self-taught, trial and error as there weren’t any resources for FX in the Midwest at that time.</p><p>Anthony studied illustration for his BFA at the American Academy of Art in Chicago, Illinois, where he also served as the class of 2008 valedictorian. Even though he studied illustration to gain a solid foundation in color theory, composition, anatomy, and art, he continued to educate himself in sculpture, makeup, and special effects by using the principles he acquired from 2-dimensional visual storytelling.</p><p>He worked as an intern at the storied Stan Winston Studio in 2007 where he contributed to the effects teams for James Cameron’s Avatar, Indiana Jones 4, and other advertisements. Since he viewed Jurassic Park for the first time in the second grade and discovered that Stan Winston was the director of this and other beloved FX films like Batman Returns, The Monster Squad, Terminator, Predator, and Aliens, Anthony has looked up to Stan Winston. Anthony’s best memory is still working as an intern for his hero, Stan, barely eight months before Stan’s death.</p><p>Through his studio, Anthony started instructing students in the Art of FX in 2011 and developed a range of specialized courses and workshops. The kind of FX education, training, and resources he wishes he could have had when he was first starting out but that did not exist at the time he wanted to bring to the Midwest. Despite his busy schedule of working on film and television productions, he still finds time to teach specialized workshops in between assignments.</p><p>In addition to FX, Kosar is a well-recognized fine artist, illustrator, and sculptor who has won awards from numerous organizations, including the American Watercolor Society, Illinois Watercolor Society, Society of Illustrators of Los Angeles, and several more. He was selected by Watercolor Artist Magazine as “One to Watch” in 2009.</p><p>His work has been chosen to be included in numerous volumes of Infected by Art, SPECTRUM: The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art, and SPLASH 13: Best of Watercolor. He was privileged to be appointed as one of the SPECTRUM 21 judges and to be given the task of creating the new Spectrum Awards for SPECTRUM 24-27 through design and sculpture.</p><p>Anthony has also been juried into IlluXCon’s “Main Show” for the last eight years. Along with creating fine art paintings and sculptures, he curates art gallery exhibitions at his Kosart Gallery, including the highly anticipated Annual MALEFICIUM Dark Art Exhibitions, and designs and sculpts prototypes for toys, collectibles, and medical anatomical models. He also illustrates novels and comic books.</p><h3><strong>Anthony Kosar Age</strong></h3><p>Anthony Kosar was born on 2 November 1985. Hence, in 2023, he reached 38 years old.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Anthony Kosar Parents?</strong></h3><p>Anthony Kosar is the son of Lynda Kosar and Joseph Kosar. Joseph, who is age 70, was born in June 1953. Lynda, meanwhile, turned 71 in September 2023.</p><p>On Mother’s Day 2021, Anthony wished his mom, “Happy Mother’s Day to these three incredible women! I’m lucky to enjoy the company of my Mom and Grandma today while thinking of my other Grandma and knowing she’s watching over us. ❤️ <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#happymothersday</a> <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#mothersday</a> <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#mothers</a> <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#mom</a> <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#grandma</a> <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#yiayia</a>.”</p><p>Joseph is a doctor of naprapathy, also known as the connective tissue specialist.</p><p>His parents were very supportive of his career as an artist and curator. They were credited for their work which made the Maleficium Dark Art Exhibition possible in 2011.</p><p>Anthony has one sister named Melissa Kosar. Melissa who is 41 years old is working as a director at ABC Network. Her IMDB reveals that she is known for &nbsp;Abbott Elementary (2021),&nbsp;The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers (2021),&nbsp;and&nbsp;American Housewife (2016).</p><h3><strong>Is Anthony Kosar Married?</strong></h3><p>No, Anthony Kosar is not married yet but he has a partner named Marlena Chester Ochoa.</p><p>Marlena hailed from <span class=xt0psk2>Aurora, Illinois.

They celebrated the day of love attending the show in Cabaret Zazou. He captioned the post, “<span class="x193iq5w xeuugli x1fj9vlw x13faqbe x1vvkbs xt0psk2 x1i0vuye xvs91rp xo1l8bm x5n08af x10wh9bi x1wdrske x8viiok x18hxmgj">I had the most wonderful Valentine’s Day yesterday with my beautiful Valentine <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz notranslate _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>@itsmarleymann</a>.
