Fans in other countries are beginning to speculate that she and Croatian cellist Stjepan Hauser are dating. However, neither of them has made it clear whether they are a romantic couple or just a charming duo. The captions on some of Hauser’s photos have included such phrases as “Family is rising,” “Autumn, the most romantic season…,” and the like. Following these captions, many of their fans are left wondering if the couple is, in fact, a couple or just friends. Another indication that they may be romantically involved is that they sang duets together while in quarantine. A man by the name of Alberto Urso has previously been linked to Benedetta. Singing was a passion for the alleged couples. The 2018 Amici di Maria De Filippi competition was won by Alberto. As a result, there is no evidence that the two are dating, as their Instagram photos together are no longer visible.</p><h2>Facts</h2><ul><li>Benedetta Caretta is a singer and songwriter from Italy.</li><li>Benedetta Caretta is well-known for her duet with Croatian cellist Stjepan Hauser, as well as her appearance in “Io Canto.”</li><li>They also contacted Benedetta for the second version of the same broadcast, which aired from September 14 to December 11, 2010.</li></ul><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Singer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZnqaVmbK1wMBmmpqqlanBons%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./foreign-accent-syndrome.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Foreign Accent Syndrome, The Odd Condition That Changes Your Dialect">&larr;
