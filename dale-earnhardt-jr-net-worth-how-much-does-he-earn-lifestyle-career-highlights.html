Instead, he studied automotive and worked as a technician at his family’s company.&nbsp;However, a new service manager departed, and Earnhardt Jr. progressively increased his driving time. Dale Jr. soon learned that racing helped him to bond with his father. While this gave him the motivation to keep driving, he showed himself to be very capable behind the wheel.
