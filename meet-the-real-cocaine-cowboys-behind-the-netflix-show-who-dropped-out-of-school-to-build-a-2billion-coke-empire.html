They were Robin Hoods.”</p><p>Here we take a look at their story.</p><h2>Cocaine, millions & powerboats</h2><p>Cuban-born Augusto Falcon, known as ‘Willy’, and Salvador, known as ‘Sal’, were best friends who dropped out of Miami Senior High in Florida.</p><p>They were joined by <a href=#>Falcon’s younger brother Gustavo</a> and together started their life of crime in 1978.&nbsp;</p><p>Their illegal activities were considered anything but low profile with the trio enjoying lavish lifestyles during their drug smuggling spree.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the Eighties, Augusto and Salvador were big names in powerboat racing – winning three national championships and an Offshore Challenge between them.</p><p>They used their skills and knowledge of ocean-racing speed boats to transport drugs between South America and South Florida.</p><p>They were celebrities but they were accessible. They were Robin Hoods.</p><p><span class=quote-credit>Billy Corben, Cocaine Cowboys Filmmaker</span></p><p>In 2005, the Tampa Bay Times reported that the men stashed millions in Florida banks, which they later splashed on grand properties.</p><p>It was claimed they also used offshore bank accounts and fake businesses in the Bahamas, Dutch Antilles and Panama to hide their profits.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1991, police raided Augusto’s $9,000-a-month mansion and Salvador’s palatial home and arrested the duo.</p><p>Gustavo escaped the authorities and was on the run for 26 years before finally being apprehended.</p><p>While searching the properties, nearly $1m (£720,000) in cash and jewellery, one kilogram of gold and a small amount of cocaine was found.</p><p>Police also discovered ledgers that detailed the shipments of more than 55,000 kilos of cocaine – around 61 tonnes – between 1988 and 1991 alone.&nbsp;</p><h2>‘Bribed & threatened jurors’</h2><p>Records for their previous 10 years of operations were not found but the documents detailed how they were able to traffic drugs for so many years.&nbsp;</p><p>They included “a staggering network of contacts”, details of planes and boats used in the coke trade and correspondence with Colombia’s Medellin and Cali cartels.</p><p>The ledgers revealed their operation had stretched from South America to dozens of cities across America.&nbsp;</p><p>Augusto and Salvador faced dozens of charges between them – including drug trafficking, hiring hitmen to kill snitches and more.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1996, they were acquitted by a jury but not all was as it seemed.&nbsp;</p><p>Three years later, it emerged that the cunning duo had bribed jurors and officials – some up to $500,000 (£356,000), according to Associated Press.</p><p>This discovery led to them being retried and while being held in jail, it was alleged that they tried to intervene with court proceedings yet again.&nbsp;</p><h2>‘Major escape risk’</h2><p>Prosecutors claimed the duo tried to bribe people, had threatened witnesses and ahead of their second trial two government witnesses died and two others were wounded&nbsp;</p><p>The defence denied their clients played any part in the violence.</p><p>A court-ordered report found the men had paid off prison guards, which allowed them special privileges including a private mobile phone for $5,000 (£3,600)</p><p>They were described as a “major escape risk” and had collected a number of newspaper articles that detailed how previous prisoners had escaped.</p><p>Salvador was alleged to have seduced a paralegal and engaged in “unauthorised physical contact” – reportedly sex – while visiting on legal business.&nbsp;</p><h2>Sentencing & Castro payback fears</h2><p>By 2003, Salvador was sentenced to 205 years in jail for a number of offences, which was later reduced by 10 years on appeal.</p><p>And Augusto received 20 years as part of a plea deal to accept guilt for one charge of money laundering.</p><p>Authorities tried to deport Augusto back to his home nation, Cuba – while he was a US resident because he had not passed the final stage of his citizenship test.&nbsp;</p><p>His lawyers protested that his life would be in danger due to them donating “very generously” to certain political groups.</p><p>They included paramilitary organisations that had tried to assassinate Cuba’s leader Fidel Castro – they were unsuccessful and he died of natural causes in 2016.</p><p>Augusto was eventually deported to the Dominican Republican, where he currently resides, and Salvador remains at a Supermax prison in Colorado.</p><p>Corben said: “It is the most secure prison in the United States under some of the harshest conditions in the US.</p><p>“With some of the worst terrorists and violent offenders in this country, where he will serve the next 180 some odd years and you know, he will very likely die.”</p><h2>Gustavo’s 26 years on the run</h2><p>While they took the rap, Gustavo remained on the run for 26 years until 2017 when he was finally arrested on a bike ride with his wife in Kissimmee, Florida.</p><p>He avoided capture with a number of fake ID cards, which were used by the criminal and his family, including two children who were in their thirties.&nbsp;</p><p>But in 2013, Gustavo was involved in a car accident and mistakenly gave a Miami address that police knew was linked to forged driving licences in 1997.</p><p>Prior to then, authorities believed the drug trafficker had fled to either Cuba, Mexico or Colombia.&nbsp;</p><p>It emerged that Gustavo and his wife had been living under the names Luis and Maria Reiss for 14 years at an address in Kissimmee.&nbsp;</p><p>It was probably the most prolific smuggling operation we have found here in South Florida</p><p><span class=quote-credit>Christopher Clark, Assistant Attorney</span></p><p>In 2017, he was arrested by police and later was jailed for 11 years after pleading guilty to one count of cocaine distribution.</p><p>The charge was related to his part in arranging a 400-kilo shipment of cocaine from Southern California to South Florida in 1989.</p><p>Assistant attorney Christopher Clark told the Miami Herald that Gustavo was his brother Augusto’s “right-hand man”.</p><p>He held a number of roles within the criminal empire, which could have been worth more than $2.1bn (£1.5bn).&nbsp;</p><p>They included maintaining transaction ledgers, collecting millions in cocaine profits, finding drug stash houses and arranging transportation of the drugs.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr Clark said: “It was probably the most prolific smuggling operation we have found here in South Florida.</p><p>“Obviously, this case has had a long and winding road.”</p><p><strong>Cocaine Cowboys: The Kings Of Miami is available to stream on Netflix now.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
