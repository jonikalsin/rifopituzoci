He was 42.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Elvis Presley at Graceland in 1957 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Dr. Jerry Francisco, the coroner who performed a two-hour autopsy on the artist, confirmed that he had passed away from <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/01/03/specials/presley-obit.html?scp=4&sq=99%2520Anthems&st=cse">cardiac arrest</a> that was caused by prescription medications and an unhealthy diet.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Dr. Francisco also believed the singer's previous issues with hypertension and coronary artery disease could have contributed to his death. Dr. Francisco confirmed there had been no signs of illicit substances in the autopsy.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Some years after Elvis' death, there were claims that Elvis had been a drug abuser and that the pills he had taken were what killed him. Some even blamed the doctor who had prescribed him the medications, saying he should have known Elvis would abuse them.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Elvis Presley in Culver City, California at MGM Studios in 1962 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Linda Thompson, who lived with Elvis for years after his divorce, said he had been abusing illicit substances since the 1950s, and Stanley said he had never seen someone use drugs the way his stepbrother had.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>His drug use reportedly greatly concerned those close to him, with Thompson saying that Elvis' death could have happened several times before August 1977 had she not been there for him.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Elvis Presley performing on stage in 1975 | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:initial>Thompson felt a responsibility to be there for Elvis as she knew he had a self-destructive streak, and she did not want to watch him go down that road, so she became acutely aware of his needs and habits.
