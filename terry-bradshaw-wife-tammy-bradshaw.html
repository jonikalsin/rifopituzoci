However, apart from his professional life, Terry has also been dragged into the spotlight for the troubles of his personal life.</p><p>And his fourth marriage with former model <strong>Tammy Bradshaw</strong> was all over the news. However, despite Bradshaw’s popularity and notoriety, his spouse has done an excellent job of staying out of the spotlight.</p><p>Naturally, many are curious to know more about the beauty who stole Terry’s heart. So, stay with us to the end if you want to discover more about Terry Bradshaw’s wife, Tammy Bradshaw.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Have_Been_Married_Since_1999></span>Have Been Married Since 1999<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Anyone familiar with Terry Bradshaw is well informed about his marriage with <strong>Tamera Alice</strong>. The now-married pair first met while they were both getting out of their divorces. Tammy was patient with the former footballer since Terry was hesitant to give his heart to anyone else. Nonetheless, he decided to give love one more chance, and it paid off handsomely.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Terry and Tammy got married on July 8, 2014, in the most unconventional way possible. Terry&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>told Closer Weekly</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> in an interview that he passed his future wife in the corridor and told her they would be getting married in Hawaii, which they did. However, by the time they chose to get married, the pair had been together for more than 15 years.</span></p><p></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nonetheless, the love-smitten couple later&nbsp;</span><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external><span data-preserver-spaces=true>renewed their vows</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;during a trip to Hawaii. Terry and Tammy have now been happily married for seven-year.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>So, we wish Terry Bradshaw’s wife and family well and hope that they may enjoy more pleasures in the future.</span></p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Meet John S.

One of them was when her first child, <strong>David Cody Luttrull</strong>, died on July 6, 2009, from an accidental heroin overdose.</p><p>David was Tammy’s first and only son, so the loss must have been devastating for her. Despite this, she had Terry by her side when she lost her child, and the two of them began working together to raise awareness about opiate addiction.</p><p>It must have been a relief to have a shoulder to lean on in such a difficult time. After all, isn’t that what the love of your life is supposed to be?</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Of_A_Philanthropic_Nature></span>Is Of A Philanthropic Nature<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following her son’s death, Terry Bradshaw’s wife became involved in several organizations to make a difference and provide others who have fallen into the never-ending cycle of addiction a second chance at life.</p><p>In 2019, Tammy and her husband competed on&nbsp;Celebrity Family Feud, winning $10,000 for the 525 Foundation. Similarly, the pair has actively supported charities such as the Opioid Solution Fundraiser and No Kid Hungry.</p><p>Moreover, Tammy has also given significant donations to Chris Long’s Waterboys Initiative, which helps drought-stricken areas in Africa by building wells.</p><p>Additionally, Tammy Bradshaw’s husband is also active with many organizations, including the American Humane Association, the Friars Foundation, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and the New York Restoration Project.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Terry_Bradshaws_Wife_Was_Previously_Married></span>Terry Bradshaw’s Wife Was Previously Married<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although many Hollywood couples have made their love last, celebrities are known for short romances and failed marriages. Yet you have to admire those who keep returning to the altar because they refuse to give up on love.</p><p>Terry Bradshaw’s spouse, Tammy, is one of those who had difficulty finding the right person. Tammy had previously been married to <strong>David Luttrull</strong>, but the couple had only been wedded for a couple of years before deciding to split in 1988 officially. The cause for the separation has not been revealed to the public; however, some sources suggest it was a mutual decision.</p><p>While the couple was unable to endure the ups and downs of their relationship, they did have two children during their time together. The former couple had a son named David Cody Luttrull, who, as mentioned before, died of drug overuse.</p><p>Similarly, the ex-pair also shares a daughter named <strong>Lacey Hester-Luttrull</strong>, who is very close to Tammy.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>A post shared by Tammy Bradshaw (@tameria_bradshaw)</a></p><p>However, following the divorce, Tammy’s ex-husband avoided the media. On the other hand, Tammy married Terry Bradshaw and has appeared in several tv-shows.</p><p>So we wish Tammy and Terry the best and hope that their relationship continues to blossom as the years progress.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Terry_Bradshaw_Was_Married_Thrice_Before_He_Met_Tammy></span>Terry Bradshaw Was Married Thrice Before He Met Tammy<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Just like Tammy, her husband Terry had also tied the knot before the pair got together. Terry Bradshaw’s first wife was <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Melissa Babish</strong></a>, Miss Teenage America, in 1969. The couple married in 1972, but their union only lasted a year.</p><p>They were soon divorced, and Terry moved on with American figure skater <strong>Alicia&nbsp;Starbuck</strong> three years after they separated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Terry-Bradshaw-Wife-Tammy-Bradshaw.jpg><p>JoJo and Terry exchanged wedding vows in 1976. Unfortunately, this marriage did not stand the test of time, and the ex-partners divorced shortly after they split in 1983.</p><p>Terry then married <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Charlotte Hopkins</strong></a> the same year his second divorce got finalized. The ex-couple was married for almost two decades and had two kids, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Rachel Bradshaw</strong></a> and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Erin Bradshaw</strong></a>. However, Bradshaw’s daughters stay close to him despite the separation and are frequently featured on his reality show, The Bradshaw Bunch.</p><p>And if the expression “All is well that ends well” had a proper context to be applied in, this would be it. Terry is now happily married to Tammy and living a pleasant life, despite three complicated divorces and years of anguish. So, we wish the pair eternal happiness.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcMDEq6myZZKnrqW%2Fx5quZq%2BZm7JuwMCmpLJlkqeupb%2FHmq5o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chumlee-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chumlee Net Worth: TV Career &amp;amp; Lifestyle">&larr;
