He was initially sentenced to 20 years jail, however, it was reduced and he was out of prison after 4.5 years. After his return, he started a media career working as a radio host, and as an actor.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich George Gordon Liddy is, as of mid- 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Liddy’s net worth is as high as $5 million, an amount earned through his successful careers.</p><h3>G. Gordon Liddy Net Worth $5 Million</h3><p>Gordon is the son of James Liddy, and his wife Maria, and is of Irish and Italian ancestry. He spent his childhood in Hoboken, and West Caldwell, New Jersey, and went to Saint Benedict’s Preparatory School, located in Newark, New Jersey, which he finished when he was only 17 years old. Gordon then enrolled at Fordham University from which he graduated in 1952, and then enlisted in the US Army, and was about to be sent to the Korean War as an artillery officer, however, for medical reasons he was left in the USA. Two years later he was out of the army and back to the Fordham University, studying law at the School of Law. He obtained his degree in 1957, and joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), serving under its first president J. Edgar Hoover.</p><p>He served in the FBI until 1962, becoming the youngest Washington DC Bureau Supervisor at the age of 29. After leaving the FBI, Gordon went on to work as a lawyer and politician, which ultimately led to a spot in Richard Nixon’s Administration. He rose in rank and became Nixon’s right hand in scheming plots against the Democratic opposition; this eventually led to the Watergate scandal in which Gordon and several other of Nixon’s people broke into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate Complex. Gordon faced burglary, conspiracy and illegal wiretapping charges and was eventually sentenced to 20 years. Anyways, President <a href=#>Jimmy Carter</a> reduced the sentence to eight years, and Gordon was out after 4.5 years in prison, on parole.</p><p>Following his release, Gordon published the autobiography “Will”, which sold in millions of copies, and was later made into a film, which increased his wealth to a large degree. Then in 1992, he started hosting his own show which lasted until 2012 when he decided to retire. The show became extremely popular, and in 2009 alone was syndicated to 160 markets by Radio America, and on both Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio stations in the United States.</p><p>Gordon also tried himself as an actor upon his release from prison, and appeared in around 20 film and TV titles, which also added to his wealth. Some of his most notable portrayals include Merrick in the action film “The Highwayman” (1987), then Jim Miller in the sci-fi action film “Street Asylum” (1990), then as Al Dorn in the action comedy “Adventures in Spying” (1992), and as Jacob Calder in the TV action crime-drama series “18 Wheels of Justice” (2000-2001).</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Gordon was married to Frances Ann Purcell from 1957 until her death in 2010. Gordon and she were parents to five children. He still lives in New York City.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=11.679536679537><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>G.
